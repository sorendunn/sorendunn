# 👋 Hi, I’m Soren
- 📚 I recently graduated from the University of Chicago where I triple majored in Data Science, Chemistry, and Statistics
- 📫 Here's my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-zMqEebBi4nZOWuhZrpOuuPK-YK-Thb/view?usp=sharing)
- 😄 I enjoy messing around with LLMs, contra dancing, and statistical brain-teasers
